**Description**


Based on Centos 7, this is an unofficial fork of the official OSSEC project docker container.
Note: this can be easily adapted for RHEL 7 for FIPS-140-2 compliance.

Adapated with a focus of running in Kubernetes, there is an agent and server container, and
the assumption that configurations and persistent storage are mounted into the container via
Kubernetes manifests.
